How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

To interpret user needs, I listen to what the user wants to accomplish, not just the key features they are asking for. I break their needs into clear goals and figure out how to turn those goals into a program that solves their issues. Creating user stories helps by putting the user's needs into simple statements that guide development. Each user story focuses on what the user wants and why. This allows me to stay focused on building features that matter.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I develop programs, I break the work into small pieces. I start by finding and understanding what the problem is, then I plan my steps, build a rough draft, and improve the program through testing and feedback. In the future, I would like to incorporate Agile processes like sprint planning to organize my tasks, daily standups to stay on track, and retrospectives to reflect and improve after a project. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, respecting other people's ideas, and doing my share in the work. It also means that I need to be open to feedback and help others when they are in need of support. A good team member should focus on the success of the project and not just their part. It is also important to stay positive when there are issues.
